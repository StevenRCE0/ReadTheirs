# ReadTheirs - A Tool for Browsing Through Repositories

## Usage

Example:

```bash
go run main.go -b main -o zed https://github.com/StevenRCE0/ReadTheirs
```

...in which -b and -o are optional, but -b is
set to "HEAD" by default.

## Expand

The script leaves `expand.sh`, which allows you to clone the full repo in place, directly.
